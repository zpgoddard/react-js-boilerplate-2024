# SHOWSTOPPER WEB CLIENT

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

### `yarn lint`

Runs our ocnfigured linter and lets you know all the problems and warnings to fix across all files with an auto-fix option availabel for some of them.

### `yarn coverage`

Tests all files, returning whether they passed or not, and giving a report on how much of the project is tested and 'covered' by unit tests.

### `yarn watch`

Continues to run in terminal a command that tests open and relevant scripts you are working after a change is made, letting you know whether they are passing or failing their tests.

### `yarn watchAll`

Same as watch but instead does this with all tests in the entire project. 

Since this is triggered everytime after something is changed and covers every test, this can begin to make things very slow the more tests you have.
